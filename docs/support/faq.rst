General questions
-----------------

So what is this thing really?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Firefly III is a web application written in PHP 7.1 with a database behind it that can be the tool you use to manage your personal finances. For more information, please read the :ref:`full description <introduction>`.

Can I try it first?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Yes, you can! <https://demo.firefly-iii.org/>`_.

How can I use it? I don't get it?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must install it yourself on webhosting of your choice, or on a webserver you have access to. The menu on the left has various options to try.


I have found a security related issue!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please :ref:`contact me asap <security>`.

I have to access Firefly III through /public/ and it gives me a warning?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This means that the Document Root of your webserver is configured wrong. You should configure your webserver in such a way that ``/`` corresponds to ``/public``. If you do not, you run the risk of exposing your database credentials, sessions and other sensitive financial data to the world.

There are several `tutorials online <https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-move-an-apache-web-root-to-a-new-location-on-ubuntu-16-04>`_ that explain how to change your document root.

I want to use SQLite?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is not much to it. Open your ``.env`` file and find the lines that begin with ``DB_``. These define your database connection. Leave ``DB_CONNECTION``. Delete the rest.

.. code-block:: bash

   DB_CONNECTION=sqlite

Then, in order to install the database, make sure the file ``/storage/database/database.sqlite`` exists. When it does not exist, you can use this command on Linux to create it:

.. code-block:: bash

   touch ./storage/database/database.sqlite

Then you are ready to install the database in SQLite:

.. code-block:: bash

   php artisan migrate --seed
   php artisan firefly:upgrade-database
   php artisan firefly:verify

And presto!

I want to use PostgreSQL?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In your ``.env`` file, change the ``DB_CONNECTION`` to ``pgsql``. Update the other ``DB_*`` settings to match your database settings. The default port for PostgreSQL is 5432.

Then you are ready to install the database in PostgreSQL:

.. code-block:: bash

   php artisan migrate --seed
   php artisan firefly:upgrade-database
   php artisan firefly:verify

I see a white page and nothing else?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check out the log files in ``storage/logs`` to see what is going on. Please open a ticker if you are not sure what to do. If the logs are empty  Firefly III cannot write to them. Make sure that the web server has write access to this directory. If the logs still remain empty, do you have a ``vendor`` directory in your Firefly III root? If not, run the Composer commands.

I get a 404?
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you run Apache, open the ``httpd.conf`` or ``apache2.conf`` configuration file (its location differs, but it is probably in ``/etc/apache2``).

Find the line that starts with ``<Directory /var/www>``. If you see ``/``, keep looking!

You will see the text ``AllowOverride None`` right below it. Change it to ``AllowOverride All``.

Also run the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo a2enmod rewrite
   sudo service apache2 restart

That should fix it!

I get "Be right back"?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Answer be here.

When I login, I get "Page has expired"?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Answer be here

Can I use it on PHP 5.x?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No. Most code has been written specifically for PHP 7.1 and higher.

It is very slow on my server?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Raspberry Pi's and other microcomputers are not the most speedy devices. User `ndandanov <https://github.com/ndandanov>`_ has very kindly tested what works best, and found out that `installing PHP OpCache is a very good way to speed up Firefly III <https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii/issues/1095#issuecomment-356975735>`_.

I used a default key, can I re-key the database?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you accidentally used a blank key or used a default value instead of a secure one, `ndandanov <https://github.com/ndandanov>`_ has written a few scripts that should help `you re-encrypt the database <https://github.com/ndandanov/firefly-iii-reencrypt-database>`_.

Decimal points are missing, numbers are off?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ensure with `dpkg-reconfigure locales` that the language you want to use is installed, then reboot Apache or Nginx (webserver).

I get 'Unexpected question mark'?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Firefly III requires PHP 7.1 or higher.

I get 'BCMath' errors?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You see stuff like this:

.. code-block:: bash

   PHP message: PHP Fatal error: Call to undefined function
   FireflyIII\Http\Controllers\bcscale() in
   firefly-iii/app/Http/Controllers/HomeController.php on line 76


Solution: you haven't enabled or installed the BCMath module. Install it.

I get 'intl' errors?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Errors such as these:

.. code-block:: bash

   production.ERROR: exception
   'Symfony\Component\Debug\Exception\FatalErrorException' with message
   'Call to undefined function FireflyIII\Http\Controllers\numfmt_create()'
   in firefly-iii/app/Http/Controllers/Controller.php:55

Solution: You haven't enabled or installed the Internationalization extension. If you are running FreeBSD, install ``pecl-intl``.

I get 'Error: Call to undefined function ctype_alpha()'?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This may happen when you are on a NAS4free Debian installation or similar platform. This command may help:

.. code-block:: bash

   pkg install php71-ctype

I get 'Error: could not open input file artisan'?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure you run the artisan commands in the ``firefly-iii`` directory.

I get 'Error: call to undefined function numfmt_create()'?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure you have installed and enabled the PHP intl extension.

Importing data
--------------

I'm getting prompted by Salt Edge to request test access. Am I doing it wrong?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Salt Edge <https://www.saltedge.com/>`_ doesn't just let you import data. Once you have created an account and set up Firefly III to import data from their systems you can only import test data at first. You'll have `to contact them <https://www.saltedge.com/test_access>`_ to get your account upgraded.

This is a bit annoying, having to jump through hoops to get Salt Edge access, but it's the best I can do. Since Firefly III is open source software, I cannot share my secret keys. They would be out on the street. So, each user has to get their own access to Salt Edge.

Other questions
---------------

I keep getting redirected to the index after editing something
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're running Firefly III in a reverse proxy environment, please check if you have the following configuration:

.. code-block:: bash

   Referrer-Policy: strict-origin


If this is the case, please change it to:

.. code-block:: bash

   Referrer-Policy: same-origin

That should solve it.
